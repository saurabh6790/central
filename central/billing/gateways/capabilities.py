"""What a gateway may do in one currency (ADR 0022).

The silent-debit ceiling is a property of *(gateway, currency)*, not of the
provider. Stripe pulls any amount in USD and at most ₹15,000 in INR, because the
RBI ceiling follows the currency and the merchant's country rather than the brand
on the rail. A per-adapter scalar cannot say that, so the ceiling lives on the
`Payment Gateway Currency` row and this module is the only place that reads it.

Amounts here are floats in MAJOR units (₹, $), like all money in billing.
