"""Reading Billing Settings.

Every billing knob is read through a named function here rather than off the
document, so a caller asks for the policy ("how many days until this invoice is
due?") instead of knowing which field on which Single holds it.

The document is read with `get_cached_doc`, which applies the DocType's field
defaults when nobody has saved the Single yet. Those defaults are therefore the
real fallbacks, and they live in one place — the JSON — instead of being repeated
as constants here. The one exception is the per-currency welcome grant: child rows
can't have defaults, so `ensure_welcome_credit_amounts` seeds them on install.
