"""Notification suite — Cloud Billing is the sole sender (issue #20).

v1 sent duplicate emails from both Press and the gateway. v2 routes every
customer-facing billing notification through this one module: it records a
Notification Log per team and is the only thing that sends. Gateways never
email the customer.

Each call also drops an Info comment on the referenced doc (Desk audit trail);
email dispatch goes through the unified notification engine.
