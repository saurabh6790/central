"""Customer dashboard endpoints (issues #26, #18).

Every endpoint is auto-scoped to the caller's team via Central's capability IAM
(ADR 0004): reads require `billing:view`, mutations `billing:manage`. A member
without the capability — including the cluster Agent key — is rejected, and
passing another team's name is never silently widened. Cross-team admin data
lives on the admin dashboard (#19) behind the operator (System Manager) bypass.

Split into domain modules (account / invoices / methods) with shared helpers;
this package re-exports the public API so every `billing.api.dashboard.*` path
stays stable.
