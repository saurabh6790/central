"""What we will charge next, and whether it will work.

The engine already answers the second half: `projection.outcomes.derive` reports
failure only where the team's own state entails it — no active method, a bill over
the silent-debit ceiling, a mandate whose cap sits below the invoice. It reuses the
production helpers the collector runs on, so the two cannot disagree about who can
be charged.

What it does not do is speak to a customer. Its findings are written for an operator
reading a book of teams ("the customer has to act", "lands in Action Required"), so
this module keeps the reasoning and replaces the prose: one entry per finding code,
saying what happened and what to do about it. An unmapped code falls back to the
finding's own summary, which is a short neutral phrase rather than operator detail.
