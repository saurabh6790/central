"""Why collection will fail — asserted only where the team's state entails it.

Whether a card will succeed is unknowable, so a projection never pretends. But a
great deal of failure is not a guess at all: a team with no active payment method
will not be auto-charged, an INR bill over the silent-debit threshold lands in Action
Required by design, a mandate whose ceiling sits below the invoice cannot be debited.
Those are facts already in the database, and reporting only those is what turns the
simulator from a picture into a pre-flight check on the book.

Three modes, and the output always says which produced it:

  Optimistic  everything settles on time.
  Assumed     the operator declares the outcome; the calendar follows their word.
  Derived     failure is reported only where state entails it, silence otherwise.

Every rule below reuses the production helper that governs it — `silent_threshold`,
`effective_cap`, `settlement_sources`, `ordered_methods` — so the simulator and the
collector cannot disagree about who can be charged.

One helper is deliberately *not* used. `collection_mode.evaluate()` decides the same
threshold question but **trips the profile into Action Required as a side effect**,
which is a write. A projection asks; it does not push the team into a new mode.
