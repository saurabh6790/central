Billing is a **postpaid, in-arrears** money system: Central provisions resources, records
the runtime it bills from, draws up an invoice in arrears, settles it (credits → card),
and chases the unpaid ones. There is **no Subscription Agent** (ADR 0006) — Central
provisions/records/enforces directly. Authorisation is Central's capability IAM
(ADR 0004), not billing-owned roles.

- **36 DocTypes**, **~10 sub-packages**, **87 whitelisted endpoints**.
- Money is **float `Currency` in major units** (₹10.00 is stored `10.0`). Conversion to gateway minor
  units (Razorpay paise / Stripe cents) happens **only at the gateway boundary**. ADR 0003
  (integer minor units) is **DEPRECATED — it was never implemented**; don't design against it.

### Scheduled (`central/hooks.py` → `scheduler_events`)
| Cadence | Entry point | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| daily | `revenue.invoicing.collect_due_invoices` | phase 2 — sweep every Draft whose month has closed, fan drafts out as page jobs |
| daily | `payments.collection.charge_scheduled_invoices` | first ask on invoices held for a team's chosen billing date |
| daily | `revenue.dunning.run_dunning` | Day 1/3/7 retries → past_due → suspend → terminate |
| daily | `payments.reconciliation.run_reconciliation` | charged-but-never-webhooked gateway scan |
| daily | `payments.charges.cleanup_payment_logs` | prune Payment Attempt / Webhook Event |
| daily | `payments.emandate.run_emandate_cycle` | INR ≤₹15k pre-debit notice → debit after 24h |
| daily | `catalog.subscriptions.backfill_missing_subscriptions` | Subscription for any Running Asset missing one |
| hourly | `revenue.erpnext_sync.retry_failed_syncs` | retry Sales Invoice push (backoff window elapsed) |
| monthly | `payments.payments.expire_payment_methods` | flip cards past their printed month |
| cron `0 1 1 * *` | `revenue.invoicing.draft_monthly_invoices` | phase 1 — hand the month's teams out as page jobs |

**The monthly run is two ticks, and neither of them does the work.** Each is an
orchestrator: it keyset-pages its subjects and enqueues a **page job** per slice —
`draft_team_page(after, until)` / `settle_draft_page(cutoff, after, until)` —
deduplicated on the slice's upper bound. A page job re-derives its slice from the
bounds and works it in order, committing after **each team / each invoice**: the page
is the unit of *scheduling*, the team is still the unit of *work*, so a job killed
at team 300 of 500 keeps the 299 it finished.

Drafting fires once, on the 1st; collection is a **daily** sweep, not a single tick a
fixed few hours later. At scale drafting can still be running when a one-shot collect
would fire, and that scan would collect only the drafts that existed at that instant
and orphan the rest — with no later pass to catch them. `collect_due_invoices` instead
opens every Draft whose month has closed (`period_end <= the just-closed month`) and
re-runs daily until nothing is owed, so a late draft, or one a settle page left behind
(this month's or an older run's), is swept up rather than stranded. A settled draft
drops out of the scan, so once the run has drained the sweep is a cheap indexed no-op.

Not a job per team, deliberately. At a million teams that is a million redis
round-trips in one scheduler tick — a cron job runs on a **300-second** timeout
(`get_queue_name()` gives cron jobs the `default` queue), so it would be killed
around 150k teams having never handed out the rest, and a million queued jobs is
gigabytes of redis. Two thousand page jobs cost seconds and megabytes.

**The billing queue is the throughput knob and the rate-limit cap, at once.** The run
uses its own queue, not `long`, configured in `common_site_config.json`:

```json
"workers": {"billing": {"timeout": 3000, "background_workers": 8}}
```

Because a page job works its invoices *sequentially*, the number of billing workers
is exactly the number of gateway charges in flight. That is the only thing standing
between a million-invoice month and a wall of 429s — there is no token bucket yet, so
**this number is the rate limit**. Set it against the gateway's documented ceiling
(Stripe ≈ 100 req/s; a charge is ~2s, so W workers ≈ W/2 req/s). Raising it is how
you go faster; there is no other dial. `billing_queue()` falls back to `long` with a
warning if the bench hasn't declared the queue — enqueuing to a queue nobody consumes
would mean the month silently never gets billed.

A unit that fails is contained: logged to the billing log file *and* as a
`Billing Run Failure` Error Log row, rolled back to its own savepoint, and re-attempted
by the next tick since both phases are idempotent. If the savepoint itself is gone —
the database restarted, the connection dropped — the failure is **re-raised** instead:
that is the machinery breaking, not a bad team, and containing it would turn one
outage into a silent run in which nobody was billed.

Why both ticks land on the 1st rather than the documented 28th/1st: a calendar month
billed in arrears is not closed until it ends, so drafting on the 28th would bill days
that had not happened. The split that matters is heavy-local (rating) vs slow-external
(gateway), and that is preserved — five hours apart on the same morning.

`run_monthly_billing` still runs both phases inline for demos, small sites and manual
re-runs. `billing_run_status()` reports what the current period's run has actually
achieved (drafted / pending / collected / failures), derived from the tables rather
than from a counter — read it before deciding to re-fire a tick.

**Worker math.** One collected invoice ≈ 2s (rating is ~100ms; the rest is the gateway
round-trip). Sequentially, a million invoices is ≈ 23 days. Over W billing workers it is
1M × 2s / W: **8 workers ≈ 69h, 32 ≈ 17h, 64 ≈ 9h** — and 64 workers is ~32 charges/s,
still inside a 100 req/s gateway ceiling. Drafting is cheaper (~0.3s/team): 1M teams
over 32 workers ≈ 2.6h, which does *not* fit the five-hour gap with much room to spare
at that scale — widen the gap or the pool before you get there. Size the pool from the
team count, never from the invoice amount.

**What the run actually contends on.** The tables a draft reads — Subscription,
Subscription Change, Payment Method, Catalog Rate, Usage Rollup — are read with plain
consistent reads, which under InnoDB MVCC take **no locks at all**, so no number of
workers can make them block each other. Credit Wallet *is* locked `FOR UPDATE`, but the
key is (team, currency): a team only ever contends with its own concurrent top-up.

There is exactly one **global** lock in the run, and it is not a data table. Every
Invoice insert calls `make_autoname("INV-YYYY-MM-.#####")`, which takes the `tabSeries`
row `FOR UPDATE` and holds it **until the transaction commits** — so every worker in
the run queues behind one row. Measured on a dev bench: ~6ms held per invoice, i.e. a
ceiling of **~169 invoices/sec however many workers you add**, or ~1.6h for a million.
That sits *above* the worker-bound rate until roughly 50 billing workers (at ~0.3s of
rating per team, W workers deliver W×3.3/sec), so it is a ceiling to know about, not
one to design around yet. If you ever need past it, shard the series — `INV-YYYY-MM-A-`,
`-B-`, … per page — which GST permits as long as each series is itself consecutive.

Two things keep that lock short, and both are load-bearing:

- **One team = one transaction = one commit**, inline and fanned out alike. A page job
  that committed once at the end would hold the series row for 500 teams — minutes —
  and every other worker would hit `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` (50s by default). The
  commit inside the page loop is what makes the critical section milliseconds.
- **Contention is retried, not contained.** A lock-wait timeout (1205) or deadlock
  (1213) means the team lost a race, not that its data is bad. `draft_team_invoice`
  retries it with jittered backoff (`CONTENTION_RETRIES`), because the draft tick comes
  round once a *month* — a contained loser would go unbilled until someone noticed.
  Only after the budget is exhausted is it recorded as a `Billing Run Failure`.

**A late run never costs the customer grace.** `due_date` and `dunning_starts_on` are
both set from the day the invoice is actually *opened*, so a run three days behind
bills three days later rather than three days overdue. Beyond that, any collection
failure on our side — a 429, a dead worker, a contained run error — calls
`dunning.defer_dunning`, which pushes `dunning_starts_on` (never `due_date`, which is
an accounting fact AR aging depends on) forward to today + the standard window. It is
monotonic and self-limiting: a successful ask stops pushing, so a broken gateway defers
*escalation*, not collection.

**A team may name the day it is charged, and it moves only that.** Some customers are
funded on the 5th, not the 1st: their card declines twice and then goes through
untouched, costing them two failure notices for a bill that was always going to be
paid. `payments/billing_date.py` lets such a team pick a day (1..`max_billing_date`),
guarded by a switch on Billing Settings *and* a grant on the team's Billing Profile.
`open_and_collect` stamps the day on the invoice as `collect_on` and skips leg 2;
`collection.charge_scheduled_invoices` makes the first ask when the day arrives (the
e-mandate rail instead arms its 24h notice a day ahead, because there the notice *is*
the ask). Nothing else moves: the period is still the calendar month, the invoice is
still issued and payable on the 1st, and `due_date` / `dunning_starts_on` stay pinned
to the day it opened — which is why Billing Settings refuses a window reaching past
the due date. Dunning skips a *retry* while `collect_on` is ahead of it (we have not
asked yet), but never delays escalation.

### Lifecycle / install hooks
- `after_install` / `after_migrate` / `before_tests` → `catalog.taxonomy_setup.ensure_catalog_masters` (idempotent seed of catalog masters — ADR 0007).
- `doc_events` has **no billing entries** — billing reacts to API calls and the scheduler, not to generic DocType saves.
- `override_doctype_dashboards["Currency"]` → `api.dashboard_overrides.currency_dashboard`.

### Inbound webhooks (`payments/webhooks.py`)
`@stripe` / `@razorpay` (whitelisted, signature-first) → `process_webhook` → adapter `verify_signature`/`normalise_event` → `handle_webhook_event` → `charges.apply_webhook` (settle the Payment Attempt). Raw payload persisted to **Webhook Event** for dedupe/replay.

**Other whitelisted**: `catalog/plans.py` (create_configured_plan, get_plan_pricing), `revenue/credits.py` (purchase, adjust_credits, get_balance), `revenue/erpnext_sync.py` (sync_invoice), `payments/charges.py` (pay_invoice), `payments/payments.py` (initiate/confirm payment method, set_default, reorder, delete), `payments/webhooks.py` (stripe, razorpay), `india_gst.py`, and the `payment_gateway` / `plan_configurator` doctype controllers.

> **Gotcha:** dashboard *mutations* must declare `methods=["POST"]` — frappe-ui `useCall`
> defaults to GET, and Frappe rolls back writes on GET (the toast lies, nothing persists).

## 6. Retired / moved — don't chase ghosts

- **Price Lock doctype + event log** → RETIRED (ADR 0010). The grandfathered rate now lives as
  `locked_rate` on each **Subscription Change** row. `revenue/pricelock.py` is the thin
  shim. The `price_lock` doctype still exists but is legacy.
- **Subscription Agent / `press_billing_agent`** → gone (ADR 0006, agentless). Central calls the
  cluster-manager API directly.
- **Per-team Trust Tier doctype** → dropped; caps resolve live via `get_team_caps`.
- **billing-owned roles + `platform/security.py` + `billing_team` field** → deleted; uses
  Central capability IAM (`authz.py` → `central.iam`). Team is a `Link(Team)`, not a Data slug.
- **`billing_mode` field** → removed (v09); Billing Profile currency is the gate.

## 7. Debugging cheat-sheet — symptom → where to look

| Symptom | Start at |
|---|---|
| Invoice never generated | `billing_run_status()` — is the team in `pending_draft`? then Error Log `Billing Run Failure` for that team, the long queue for stuck jobs, and `lines.compute_line_items` for empty segments |
| Half the teams billed, half not | a partial run: read `billing_run_status()`, fix the cause, re-fire `draft_monthly_invoices` — both phases are idempotent and resume |
| Billing run never starts / jobs pile up | is there a worker on the `billing` queue? (`common_site_config.workers.billing` + `bench worker --queue billing`); the billing log warns and falls back to `long` if the queue is undeclared |
| Lock wait timeouts during the run | check the per-unit `frappe.db.commit()` in `draft_team_page`/`settle_draft_page` is still there — without it the `tabSeries` lock is held for a whole page; then check nothing new writes a shared row inside the unit |
| Run is far too slow | `background_workers` on the billing queue is the only throughput dial — but it is also the gateway concurrency cap; check for 429s (`Billing Run Failure` Error Logs, `dunning_starts_on` deferrals) before raising it |
| Customer dunned during a backlog | should be impossible: `dunning_starts_on` is pushed by `dunning.defer_dunning` on every failure of ours. If it happened, find the collection path that failed without calling it |
| Invoice wrong amount | `lines.compute_line_items` (day-weighting), `metering.metered_line_items`, `commitments` discount, `tax.resolve_tax`; verify Subscription Change `locked_rate` segments |
| Charge stuck "Open"/unpaid | `payments/webhooks.py` (signature failed? Webhook Event row?), `charges.apply_webhook`, `collection.collect_invoice` fallback chain |
| Webhook ignored | `webhooks.process_webhook` signature check; gateway `verify_signature`; dedupe against existing Webhook Event |
| Money movement blocked | `settlement.can_accept_spend` / `effective_spend_cap`; Billing Profile complete? currency set? `collection_mode.evaluate` (INR ₹15k gate) |
| Wrong price | rate resolution: `catalog/pricing.py` (`resolve_rate`/`resolve_config_rate`), `rate_card`, Plan Configurator is the single pricing authority (ADR 0011) |
| Tier/cap wrong | `catalog.entitlements` (`get_team_caps`, `evaluate_tier`, per-currency Trust Tier Threshold) |
| Provisioning failed | `catalog.subscriptions.provision_*`, `composition.validate_composition` bounds, cluster-manager call |
| Card declined repeatedly | `collection` (escalate don't repeat), `mandates.effective_cap`, dunning Day 1/3/7 |
| ERPNext out of sync | `erpnext_sync` (async, never rolls back the invoice; check retry backoff) |
| Catalog masters missing | `taxonomy_setup.ensure_catalog_masters` (runs on install/migrate/before_tests) |
| Money rounding off | money is float `Currency` (major units); check the rate field's decimal **precision** holds sub-cent rates, and that minor-unit conversion happens *only* in `gateways/` |

## 8. Tests & migrations

- **Tests** live in `tests/` (one `test_<area>.py` per concern) — the fastest way to learn a
  flow is to read its test. `tests/utils.py` (`ensure_team`) + `tests/e2e.py`.
- **Migrations** in `patches/` are `vNN_*` ordered; the most recent shape the catalog
  taxonomy (`v15`–`v24`), trust-tier currency (`v12`/`v13`), gateway customer (`v10`/`v11`),
  and team Link migration (`v03`). Check here when a field "moved" or "disappeared".
- **End-to-end Playwright** suite lives in the app root `e2e/billing/` (no-mock, real Stripe test).
