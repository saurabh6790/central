"""Phase 2 (light/parallel) + pre-payment corrections — one invoice at a time.

`open_and_collect` runs the credits-then-card waterfall and claims Draft -> Open
atomically. `cancel_invoice` / `reissue_invoice` are the pre-payment correction
path — issued line items are never mutated; a whole invoice is cancelled and
reissued from current data. Who calls these across a whole period, and on which
worker, is `run.py`'s business.
