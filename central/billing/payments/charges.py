"""Charge an open invoice and settle it on the webhook (issue #10).

The money loop: an `Open` invoice with an amount due gets a `Payment Attempt`, is
charged through the adapter, and is marked `Paid` **only** when the gateway webhook
confirms it — never on the synchronous charge response. Each retry is a new attempt;
concurrent charges of one invoice produce at most one in-flight attempt, so only one
reaches `captured`.

The attempt is saved *and committed* before the gateway is called (ADR 0017). A
crash mid-charge therefore leaves the attempt sitting at `Initiated` — a charge
whose result we don't know yet, which reconciliation can go and ask the gateway
about. It can never leave a charge with no record of it at all.
