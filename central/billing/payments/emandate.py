"""Off-session collection with the RBI pre-debit notice (ADR 0005, ADR 0022).

An Indian mandate may auto-debit silently only up to ₹15,000, and only AFTER a
pre-debit notification sent ≥24h before the debit. That is true of a Stripe India
card mandate and a Razorpay UPI Autopay mandate alike, because it is a rule about
the debit rather than about the provider. So collecting an `Auto Charge` team's
invoice is two-phase:

  1. schedule_predebit — notify the customer and stamp the earliest debit time
     (now + 24h) on the invoice. If the bill is over the silent ceiling it is NOT
     notified; it forks to Action Required instead (the manual/prepaid choice).
  2. charge_due — once the window has elapsed, run the off-session debit through
     the normal charge path, which re-checks the ₹15,000 ceiling (charges #50/1).

Both are idempotent and safe to re-run from the daily scheduler. The customer-side
heads-up is sent here; the bank's own RBI pre-debit notification is dispatched by
the gateway at debit time (an adapter concern, kept out of this orchestration).
