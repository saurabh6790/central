r"""Card Payment Method lifecycle (issue #05).

Adding a card is a two-step, gateway-mediated flow: the customer initiates
setup (Stripe SetupIntent -> client secret), confirms with the card on the
frontend, and the method is proven live by a **micro-charge captured and
immediately refunded** before it becomes `active`. A method is never trusted on
the API response alone.

    pending_validation --(micro-charge ok)--> active --(monthly expiry)--> expired
                       \--(micro-charge fail)--> failed

Cards are off-session and have no mandate ceiling (that is the UPI Autopay path,
see mandates.py). This module never imports a gateway SDK — it resolves the
adapter through the registry, keeping the gateway seam intact.
