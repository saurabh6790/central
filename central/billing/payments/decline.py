"""Which declines are final, and what we may do about them (ADR 0022).

Only a **terminal** decline justifies moving a customer to another rail. The card
was refused and will be refused again, so offering the alternative costs nothing.
An ambiguous failure is the opposite: a timeout or an abandoned 3DS may still
settle at the gateway, and charging a second rail on top of it is how one invoice
gets paid twice. Those are left to reconciliation, which can go and ask.

The distinction is worth its own module because getting it wrong is not a UX
regression — it is a double charge.
