"""Settlement fallback: primary -> backup payment methods (issue #28).

A team keeps an ordered list of active methods (Payment Method.priority). When
credits don't cover a bill, settlement charges the primary and, on failure,
rotates to the next method. Because a charge is confirmed asynchronously (the
invoice goes Paid only on the webhook, see charges.py), fallback is
event-driven, not a synchronous try/except cascade:

- A decline arrives synchronously (PaymentResult.success == False) or later as a
  webhook failure event. Both funnel into `collect_invoice`.
- `collect_invoice` charges the next active, non-re-auth method that has NOT
  already failed for this invoice (the "already failed" set is read from the
  invoice's Payment Attempt rows — no extra state).
- Immediate fallback: a synchronous decline rotates to the next method in the
  same run; a synchronous success (captured) stops and waits for the webhook.
- Escalate, don't repeat: each method is tried at most once per invoice. Once
  all have failed, `collect_invoice` returns no_method and the invoice is left
  Open for dunning (#14) to escalate — it never re-charges a failed method.
