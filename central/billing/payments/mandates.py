"""UPI Autopay mandate lifecycle (issue #08).

A mandate's ceiling is structurally tied to the team's trust-tier cap: the
mandate is authorised with `max_amount` = the current cap, so a bill can never
exceed it. A tier promotion that raises the cap requires customer re-consent
(re-authorisation); until then the team is held at the old ceiling. Cards are
exempt (off-session, any amount), so only `upi_autopay` methods participate.

This module never imports a gateway SDK directly — it resolves an adapter
through the registry, keeping the gateway seam intact (see gateways/base.py).
